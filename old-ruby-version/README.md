A quick and dirty script for extracting contact info from the NASM members list.
I use this script once a year and so it is about as well-maintained as you would
expect from that.

# Usage

Either run `bundle install`, or manually install the dependencies from
[the Gemfile](Gemfile). Then run `ruby nasm.rb` and follow the instructions.

You will end up with a file called `nasm.csv` which you can import into a
spreadsheet in Google Drive, Excel, or similar.
